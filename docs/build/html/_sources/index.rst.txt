Welcome to sc_intNMF's documentation!
=====================================


**sc_intNMF** is a python package for analysis of single cell multiomic data.
Example data found at `10x genomics <https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/single-cell-multiome-atac-plus-gene-expression>`_.
It applies non-negative matrix factorisation to learn a joint embedding of
chromatin accessibility and gene expression measured in the same cells. It also
contains methods for plotting to enable biological interpretation of results.
It offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.
